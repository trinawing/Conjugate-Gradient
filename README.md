# Conjugate-Gradient
The conjugate gradient method is an algorithm for the numerical solution of particular systems of linear equations, 
namely those whose matrix is symmetric and positive-definite. 
The conjugate gradient method is often implemented as an iterative algorithm, 
applicable to sparse systems that are too large to be handled by a direct implementation
